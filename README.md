# SKPORT Daily Sign-in Script (Google Apps Script)

[中文版](README.zh-TW.md)

This is a **Google Apps Script** that automates the daily sign-in process for **Arknights** and **Arknights: Endfield** (SKPORT/Gryphline). It runs automatically on Google's servers, so you don't need to keep your computer on.

> Based on [EndfieldCheckin](https://github.com/nano-shino/EndfieldCheckin) by nano-shino, extended to support Arknights sign-in.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get ACCOUNT_TOKEN

1.  Sign in to SKPORT at one of the following:
    - Arknights: https://game.skport.com/arknights/sign-in
    - Endfield: https://game.skport.com/endfield/sign-in
2.  Copy the code portion from the json in https://web-api.skport.com/cookie_store/account_token.

### Step 2: Install the Script

1.  Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com/).
2.  Click **+ New Project**.
3.  Delete any code currently in the editor (e.g., `function myFunction...`).
4.  **Paste** the [script](https://github.com/oao519p/SKPORTCheckin/blob/main/ArkAndEndfieldCheckIn.js) into the editor.
5.  At the top of the script, find the configuration section:
    ```javascript
    const ACCOUNT_TOKEN = "";
    ```
6.  Paste your token inside the quotation marks.

### Step 3: Setup Discord Notification (Optional)

If you want to receive a notification on Discord when the script runs:

1.  Open **Discord** and go to your server.
2.  Right-click the text channel where you want notifications.
3.  Select **Edit Channel** → **Integrations** → **Webhooks**.
4.  Click **New Webhook**.
5.  Click **Copy Webhook URL**.
6.  Go back to your Google Script and paste the URL in:
    ```javascript
    const DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "";
    ```

### Step 4: Activate the Daily Schedule

1.  Save the script (Floppy disk icon or Ctrl+S). Give the project a name (e.g., "SKPORT Daily").
2.  In the toolbar dropdown menu (next to "Debug"), select **`setupDailyTrigger`**.
3.  Click **Run**.
4.  **Authorization:**
    - Google will ask for permission to run. Click **Review Permissions**.
    - Select your Google Account.
    - You will likely see a screen saying "Google hasn't verified this app" (because it's a custom script you just made).
    - Click **Advanced** (bottom left) -> **Go to [Project Name] (unsafe)**.
    - Click **Allow**.
5.  Check the **Execution Log** at the bottom. It should say:
    > _✅ Trigger set! The 'main' function will run daily between 3 AM and 4 AM (UTC+8)._

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: The script failed with "Token Expired".** A: The `ACCOUNT_TOKEN` may expire after a few weeks or months, or if you log out of the website manually. Simply repeat **Step 1** to get a new token and update the script variable.

**Q: How do I test if it works right now?** A: In the script editor, select the function **`main`** from the dropdown and click **Run**. Check the logs or your Discord channel for the result.

**Q: How do I stop the script?** A: To stop it from running, go to the **Triggers** icon (alarm clock) on the left sidebar of the script editor and delete the trigger listed there.

**Q: My account only has Arknights / only has Endfield.** A: No problem. The script automatically detects which games are bound to your account and only signs in to those.
